# MemeMe
iPhone App (Swift 2.x)

Overview

MemeMe is an iPhone app enabling a user to take a picture, add text at the top and bottom to form a meme, and share that meme on Facebook and Twitter and also by SMS or email. Sent memes will appear in a tab view with two tabs: a table view and a collection view.

MemeMe covers many of the major iOS UI techniques and components: Setting up a navigation structure that creates an intuitive flow through the app, building tables with datasources and delegatesm, creating custom table view cells, and implementing user interfaces with tab views and collection views.

The app combines these techniques with the camera and social media activity view to create a personal user experience.
